# kosmicai

Hi, Thank you so much for this amazing opportunity. I've completed the assignment for the frontend dev role in kosmic AI. I've used the following libraries to achieve this. 
This is responsive for mobile view as well.


- React/Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- RC-Slider - for range slider

As the assignment document suggest, in terms of data I've created an object array, created seperate UI components and I'm using Next.js just to show that I'm able to use it and have been using it for some time now. I can use typescript as well but I opted to use javascript to make it simpler and as it wasn't required.

User can select a pill to show the relevant list in the dropdown and also perform text based search to select the final option.

In terms of the price range. I implemented the  UI but the UI wasn't clear as to where the range would be used.

I wanted to do some improvements to the code as well. But in order to submit this on time I'm missing out on the following.

- Many tailwind classes are value based, would try to fix or improve that by creating custom colors and values.



Please do provide me with feedback and I hope that this assignment would be able to show skills and experience in the field. Please feel free to react out to me.
